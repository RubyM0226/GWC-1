            The club’s purpose is in align with the international non-profit, “Girls Who
            Code”. We assist with their mission in closing the gender gap in computer science and STEM
            fields. The club aims to inspire, educate, and equip women, girls, and other
            underrepresented minorities with computing and programming skills in order to be agents
            of change in their communities. The focus will be base level coding knowledge and building
            on that knowledge throughout the year using block-based programming languages like
            “Scratch” and text-based programming languages like “Python”. We will expose members to
            the careers available to individuals with STEM backgrounds while giving them the
            opportunity to build their own STEM skill set. This club aims to help make the STEM and
            technology world less intimidating and available to those who are interested in it. We will
            collaborate and share projects with each other to learn specific pieces of code.
